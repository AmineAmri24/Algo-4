# Algo-4

This algo helps to verify iaf a word is a palindrome or not ( a mirror word).
the idea is simple, we need to start checking the word step by step, starting by the 1st letter and the last one.
the counters will goes further until all the letter are checked (left and right counters).
the output will be a boolean answer, it will confirm if the word is palindrome or not.
